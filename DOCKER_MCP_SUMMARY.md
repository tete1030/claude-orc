# Docker MCP Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the orchestrator to work with Docker-based Claude instances that run in isolated containers.

## Key Changes

### 1. Docker Launch Command
All Claude instances now launch using:
```bash
env CLAUDE_INSTANCE=<agent-name> CLAUDE_CONTAINER_MODE=isolated scripts/docker-claude-code.sh run
```

### 2. Shared Directory Structure
Container isolation requires shared directories for inter-container communication:
- **MCP Configs**: `/tmp/claude-orc/orchestrator_bin/`
- **Thin Proxy**: `/tmp/claude-orc/orchestrator_bin/mcp_thin_proxy.py`

### 3. Updated Components

#### `src/claude_launcher_config.py`
- Centralized configuration for Docker launch commands
- Handles command building with proper quoting

#### `src/simple_launcher.py`
- Updated to use Docker script instead of direct `claude` command
- MCP configs written to shared directory

#### `src/orchestrator.py`
- Copies thin proxy to shared location on startup
- Handles permission errors gracefully

## Working Example

The `simple_mcp_demo.py` now successfully:
1. Launches agents in Docker containers
2. Establishes MCP connections
3. Enables agent-to-agent communication

```bash
cd orchestrator
python examples/simple_mcp_demo.py
```

## Agent Communication Flow

1. **Alice** → `list_agents` → Sees Bob is available
2. **Alice** → `send_message` → "Hello Bob! I hope you're having a great day!"
3. **Bob** → `check_messages` → Receives Alice's message
4. **Bob** → `send_message` → Replies to Alice
5. **Alice** → `check_messages` → Receives Bob's reply

## Important Notes

- Session file warnings are expected (using MCP instead of file monitoring)
- The `/tmp/claude-orc/` directory must exist with proper permissions
- Each agent runs in its own isolated Docker container
- MCP provides the communication bridge between containers

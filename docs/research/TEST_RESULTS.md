# Phase 1 Test Results

## ✅ Successful Tests

1. **Core Components**
   - Import all modules: ✅
   - Tmux session creation: ✅
   - Message sending to panes: ✅
   - Pane content capture: ✅
   - Command pattern matching: ✅

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Tmux manager functionality: ✅
   - Session file detection: ✅ (2 JSONL files found)
   - Command pattern regex: ✅
   - Claude CLI executable: ✅

## 🔧 Manual Testing Needed

### Test Claude Launch
Run this to test Claude launching with custom prompts:
```bash
cd /path/to/orchestrator
python3 test_claude_launch.py
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
tmux attach -t test-claude
```

Check:
1. Does Claude start successfully?
2. Is the custom prompt applied?
3. Can Claude receive messages?

### Test Full Orchestrator
Once Claude launch works:
```bash
python3 orchestrator.py
```

This will:
1. Create two panes (Master and Worker)
2. Launch Claude in each with role-specific prompts
3. Monitor for `<orc-command>` messages
4. Route messages between agents

## 📝 Key Findings

1. **Session Files**: Located in `~/.claude/projects/*/`
2. **CLI Options**: `--append-system-prompt` works for role injection
3. **Session IDs**: `--session-id` allows tracking specific agents
4. **Tmux Control**: Send-keys works reliably for message delivery

## 🚧 Known Issues

1. **Session File Discovery**: May need adjustment based on actual Claude behavior
2. **Timing**: May need to adjust wait times for Claude startup
3. **Input During Thinking**: Not yet tested

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Run manual tests with actual Claude instances
2. Adjust timing and error handling based on results
3. Test edge cases (long messages, special characters)
4. Move to Phase 2 (multiple agents, mailbox system)
